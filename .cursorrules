# Cursor Rules for FastAPI Project

## Infrastructure Management
- **AWS CLI Usage**: Agents are welcome to use AWS CLI commands for:
  - Describing resources (describe, list, get commands)
  - Deleting resources when explicitly requested
  - Reading configuration and state information
- **Resource Creation**: All resource creation MUST be done through:
  - Terraform (preferred for AWS infrastructure)
  - Ansible (for configuration management)
  - Unless the user gives explicit consent for direct AWS CLI creation

## Code Quality
- Always run `make ci` locally before committing any changes
- Use British English spelling throughout the codebase
- Apply black and isort formatting before pushing
- Add unit tests for any new or modified code

## Git Workflow
- Push changes to develop branch (never directly to main)
- Commit changes frequently to avoid potential breakages
- Main branch is protected and requires pull requests

## Environment
- Always activate the Python virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Use the virtual environment for all Python-related commands

## Staging and Production Environments
- **CRITICAL**: When making changes to production, ALWAYS apply the same changes to staging
- The following components have BOTH staging and production environments:
  - Backend API (FastAPI)
  - Auth0 infrastructure and Actions
  - SPA web application
- The following components have PRODUCTION ONLY (no staging):
  - Wiki (MediaWiki)
  - Forum (phpBB)
- When updating Terraform, Actions, or configuration:
  - Production domain: `trigpointing.uk`
  - Staging domain: `trigpointing.me`
  - Update both unless explicitly told otherwise

## Database
- Database: trigpoin_trigs with 38 tables for trigpoint/surveying website
- Key tables: user, trig, tlog, tphoto, attr/attrval, place/town/county, etc.
- Full schema documentation available in docs/database/

## Security
- AWS origin server must only communicate over HTTPS (disable port 80)
- HTTP redirects handled at Cloudflare layer

## Frontend / Web Development

### Tailwind CSS v4 (CRITICAL)
**This project uses Tailwind CSS v4.1+, NOT v3!**

#### When Generating Code:
- ALWAYS write Tailwind v4 compatible code
- Use `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS (not `@tailwind base/components/utilities`)
- Configuration uses CSS variables and `@theme` directive, not JavaScript config for runtime theme values
- Use the Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`) setup pattern

#### When Troubleshooting Styling Issues:
**FIRST CHECK: Is this a Tailwind v3 vs v4 incompatibility?**
- Many AI models default to v3 patterns which will NOT work
- Common v3 patterns that break in v4:
  - `@tailwind` directives (use `@import "tailwindcss"` instead)
  - Arbitrary variants with underscores (e.g., `sm:hover:` nesting changed)
  - Some plugin APIs have changed
  - Class name generation differences
  - Configuration structure differences (though v3 JS config still works for basic theme extension)

#### Key v4 Features Available:
- CSS-first configuration with `@theme` directive
- Built-in container queries
- Enhanced arbitrary value syntax
- Improved performance and smaller builds
- Vite and PostCSS plugins for optimal integration

#### Reference:
- Package versions: `tailwindcss@^4.1.16`, `@tailwindcss/vite@^4.1.16`, `@tailwindcss/postcss@^4.1.16`
- Config location: `/web/tailwind.config.js` (v3-style JS config still supported)
- Setup: Uses Vite plugin in `/web/vite.config.ts`
